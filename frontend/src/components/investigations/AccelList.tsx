/** What each specialist actually does, in plain words.
 *
 *  The API's own `desc` is a terse fragment written for the orchestrator's
 *  catalogue — "Which channels, regions and retailers break" — which names a
 *  topic rather than explaining a job. These say what the agent is for and,
 *  where it matters, how to read its answer.
 *
 *  They live here rather than in `agents/roster.py` because the API's string is
 *  copied into every run at the time it is recorded: rewording the roster would
 *  leave every already-stored investigation showing the old text. Keyed by the
 *  specialist key, which is identical in both places. Anything not listed —
 *  a specialist added later — falls back to whatever the API sent.
