/** Shared mechanics for "an agent run is in progress" on Investigations and
 *  Promotion Intelligence.
 *
 *  WHAT IS SHARED IS THE MACHINERY, NOT THE MEANING. Both pages run a pipeline
 *  of phases, some with real milestones and some that can only be estimated, so
 *  the curve, the clock, the rail and the bar live here. What each phase IS,
 *  how wide its band is and when it hands over are the page's own — an
 *  investigation fans six specialists out in parallel, Promotion Intelligence
 *  computes a fact base and then runs two agents in sequence, and flattening
 *  those into one abstraction would describe neither.
 *
 *  The honesty rule both pages inherit: real milestones always win, estimates
 *  only fill the gaps between them, and nothing reaches 100% — the card
 *  unmounts when the run finishes, so a full bar could only ever mean done. */

/** Fraction complete for `elapsed` against `estimate`, as an asymptotic curve.
 *
 *  The same shape `InstallProgress` uses for the connectors, and for the same
 *  reason: a bar that reaches its end and stops reads as "finished, but
 *  frozen", which is worse than no bar. This one decelerates, so overrunning an
 *  estimate looks like slow progress — which is what it is. */

/** A ticking clock, plus one that restarts on every real event.
 *
 *  `stepKey` changes whenever something actually happened — a phase handover, a
 *  specialist reporting — so each estimate is measured from the last real event
 *  rather than from the start of the run.
 *
 *  THE STEP CLOCK IS ADJUSTED DURING RENDER, NOT IN AN EFFECT. An effect runs
 *  after the frame is committed, so the render that first saw a new milestone
 *  still measured against the PREVIOUS step's clock — one already long overrun
 *  — and the estimate was at full stretch against a further target. The bar
 *  jumped forward and then fell back: 51.8% -> 61.8% -> 52.0% on every
 *  specialist that reported. Setting it here re-renders before anything is
 *  painted, so the intermediate value never exists. */
